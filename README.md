# Snapshots of human-environmental interactions in the northeastern US

This repository includes data and code used to assess recreation patterns and cultural ecosystem services in the Northern Forest using crowdsourced Flickr data. The accompanying manuscript can be found here: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-022-01728-2

Original tabular data of Flickr images can be found in the [data folder](https://github.com/hgoldspiel/flickr/tree/master/data). Spatial data are not included in this repository due to memory limits.

All analyses were performed in R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10).
